#PredictiveEmbedding 
**FastText** is a [[NN|neural network]]-based model developed by Facebook Research that is used for [[Text Classification|text classification]], natural language processing (NLP), and text representation.

**Key Features:**

- **Fast and efficient:** Optimized for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications and large [[Dataset|datasets]].
- **Learns text embeddings:** Converts words and phrases into vector representations that capture their semantic meaning. This allows for similarity, clustering, and retrieval tasks.
- **Uses subword information:** Considers both whole words and their subwords ([[N-Gram|n-grams]]), enhancing text representation and handling out-of-vocabulary words.
- **Models text sequences:** Can be used to process variable-length text sequences, making it applicable to tasks like text generation and language modeling.

**Architecture:**

FastText consists of two main components:

- **[[Word Embeddings]] Layer:** Maps words and phrases to vector representations. These embeddings can be updated during training.
- **[[Classifier]] Layer:** Uses a neural network to predict a category or class for the input text. The network can be a simple linear layer, [[Convolutional Neural Networks|convolutional neural network]], or [[Recurrent Neural Networks|recurrent neural networks]].

**Training:**

FastText is typically trained on large text datasets using supervised learning. The model learns to associate text with corresponding labels or categories.

**Applications:**

FastText has a wide range of applications, including:

- Text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis, spam detection)
- Text similarity and clustering
- Language modeling and text generation
- Text summarization and question answering

**Advantages:**

- Fast and efficient
- Learns rich text embeddings
- Captures subword information
- Easy to train and use
- Suitable for various NLP tasks

**Limitations:**

- May not perform as well as more complex models (e.g., transformers) for certain tasks
- Requires large datasets for effective training
- Embeddings may be influenced by contextual factors
