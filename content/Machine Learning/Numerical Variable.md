also known as a [[Quantitative Variable]], is a type of variable that represents numerical values or quantities. These values can be discrete or continuous and are typically expressed as real numbers.

For example, variables like "age", "height", "weight", and "income" are numerical variables.

Numerical variables can be further categorized as discrete if they can only take on specific, separate values (e.g., integers) or continuous if they can take on any value within a range (e.g., real numbers).
