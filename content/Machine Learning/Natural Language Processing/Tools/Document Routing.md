is the process of automatically directing documents or messages to appropriate destinations based on predefined criteria or rules.

In the context of information management systems, document routing involves analyzing the content or metadata of documents to determine where they should be forwarded or delivered within an organization. This can include routing documents to specific departments, individuals, or systems based on factors such as keywords, document type, sender, recipient, or other attributes.

Document routing systems often employ techniques such as [[Text Classification]] and [[machine learning]] to automatically categorize and route incoming documents efficiently.

Overall, document routing helps streamline document handling processes, improve workflow efficiency, and ensure that documents are delivered to the right recipients in a timely manner.
