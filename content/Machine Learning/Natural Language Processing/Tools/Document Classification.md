is a task in natural language processing and machine learning where documents are assigned to one or more predefined categories or classes based on their content. It involves training a machine learning model on a labeled [[Dataset]] where each document is associated with one or more categories.

The trained model learns patterns and features from the text data to predict the appropriate category for unseen documents. Common techniques used for document classification include [[Supervised Learning|SL]] algorithms such as [[Naive Bayes]], [[Support Vector Machine|SVM]], and [[Neural Network|NN]].

Applications of document classification include [[Spam Email Detection]], [[Topic Categorization]] of news articles, and [[Document Routing]] in information retrieval systems.
