is the process of determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text, such as a sentence, paragraph, or document. It involves analyzing the text to determine whether it conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards a particular subject or topic.

For example, given the sentence "I loved the movie, it was fantastic!", sentiment analysis would classify this as positive sentiment. Conversely, the sentence "The food was terrible, I will never go back" would be classified as negative sentiment.

Sentiment analysis can be performed using various techniques, including rule-based methods, machine learning algorithms (such as [[Supervised Learning]] with labeled data), and more advanced deep learning models like [[Recurrent Neural Networks]] or [[Transformers]].

Applications of sentiment analysis include [[Social Media Monitoring]], [[Customer Feedback Analysis]], [[Brand Reputation Management]], and [[Market Research]].
