is a type of variable that can take on one of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values or categories. These categories represent qualitative data rather than numerical data.

For example, consider a categorical variable "color" with categories such as "red", "blue", and "green". Another example could be a categorical variable "gender" with categories "male" and "female".
