## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my website! Here, I document my learning journey as I delve into the fascinating world of machine learning, with a current focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Classification tasks. 

Essentially this is my second brain, where I store and organize every note, insight, and discovery along the way.

I chose Obsidian as my primary tool for documenting my learning journey due to its exceptional balance of simplicity and power. Obsidian's user-friendly interface and intuitive design make it effortless to organize and navigate my notes, allowing me to focus on capturing ideas and insights without getting bogged down by complexity.
